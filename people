' Steven Gravitz was a friend of mine who recently passed away on December 16, 2020.  He was a big influence on my life in terms of software development.  He was as expert at programming in Visual Basic, and mastered other languages and technologies as well, including .NET, C#, SQL Server.  Most importantly, Steven pointed me towards important practices and philosphies in software development, most notably functional programming and design patterns.
